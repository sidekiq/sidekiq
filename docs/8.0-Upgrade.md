# Welcome to Sidekiq 8.0!

Sidekiq 8.0 contains major new features and some breaking changes which streamline proper
operation of Sidekiq. Please read these notes carefully.

# What's New

## Job Profiling

Sidekiq 8.0 adds a new "Profile" tab which allows you to quickly and accurately profile an
executing Sidekiq job in your production environment, making performance tuning your
application code much easier. See the [Profiling](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Profiling)
wiki page for details.

## Web UI

`Sidekiq::Web` has been completely overhauled to improve security and ease of configuration.
The implementation has been significantly refactored and the CSS rewritten from scratch to remove Twitter Bootstrap.
This reduced CSS from 160KB to 16KB and average page render time from 55ms to 3ms.
See pull request [#6532](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/pull/6532) for more details.
3rd party Sidekiq Web extensions may look poor until they adapt to the new CSS.

### Data Model Changes

- The underlying class for Active Jobs has changed from `ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SidekiqAdapter::JobWrapper` to `Sidekiq::ActiveJob::Wrapper`.
  This can save a significant amount of memory when creating a large number of Active Jobs.
- The `created_at` and `enqueued_at` values within the job payload have changed type.
  Previously they were stored at epoch floats (1234567890.123456). They are now stored as
  epoch milliseconds (1234567890123) in order to avoid floating point and reduce size.

### Miscellaneous

- Removed APIs deprecated in 7.x, per our policy.
- The default job error logging now provides more detail in INFO and the full backtrace in DEBUG.

## Version Support

- Redis 7.2+, Valkey 7.2+ or DragonflyDB 1.13+
- Ruby 3.2+ is now required
- Rails 7.0+ is now supported

Support is only guaranteed for the current and previous major versions.
With the release of Sidekiq 8, Sidekiq 6.x is no longer supported.
Sidekiq 6.0.0 was released in August 2019.
