# Welcome to Sidekiq 8.0!

Sidekiq 8.0 contains major new features and some breaking changes which streamline proper
operation of Sidekiq. Please read these notes carefully.

# What's New

## Job Profiling

Sidekiq 8.0 adds a new "Profile" tab which allows you to quickly and accurately profile an
executing Sidekiq job in your production environment, making performance tuning your
application code much easier. See the [Profiling](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Profiling)
wiki page for details.

## Web UI

- `Sidekiq::Web` has been significantly overhauled to improve security and ease of configuration.
  See pull request [#6532](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/pull/6532) for more details.
- Upgraded Bootstrap CSS from 3.3.7 to 5.3.3. 3rd party Sidekiq UI extensions may look bad.
- Make the language selector in the web footer shinier.

### Miscellaneous

- Removed APIs deprecated in 7.x, per our policy.
- The default job error logging now provides more detail in INFO and the full backtrace in DEBUG.

## Version Support

- Redis 7.2+, Valkey 7.2+ or DragonflyDB 1.13+
- Ruby 3.2+ is now required
- Rails 7.0+ is now supported

Support is only guaranteed for the current and previous major versions.
With the release of Sidekiq 8, Sidekiq 6.x is no longer supported.
Sidekiq 6.0.0 was released in August 2019.

## Upgrade

As always, please upgrade Sidekiq **one major version at a time**.
If you are already running Sidekiq 6.x, then:

* Upgrade to the latest Sidekiq 7.x.
```ruby
gem 'sidekiq', '< 8'
