# Welcome to Sidekiq Pro 7.0

Sidekiq Pro 7.0 contains some breaking changes which refactor internals, remove deprecated features and update required dependency versions.

Note that version 6.x was skipped in order to synchronize Sidekiq Pro's major version number with Sidekiq 7.

## What's New

### Refactoring internals

Sidekiq 7.0's new Embedding support required substantial refactoring of Pro internals.
I've tried to maintain compatibility where possible.

### Remove statsd

The `statsd-ruby` gem doesn't see much maintenance these days whereas the `dogstatsd-ruby` gem is active and still adding features.
For this reason, statsd support has been removed and the configuration method has changed slightly:

```ruby
Sidekiq::Pro.dogstatsd = -> { Datadog::Statsd.new("localhost", 8125) } # old way

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.dogstatsd = -> { Datadog::Statsd.new("localhost", 8125) } # new way
end
```

## Version Support

- Redis 6.2+ is now required
- Ruby 2.7+ is now required
- Rails 6.0+ is now supported
- If using `dogstatsd-ruby`, v5.0+ is now required

Support is only guaranteed for the current and previous major versions. With the release of Sidekiq Pro 7, Sidekiq Pro 4.x is no longer supported.

## Upgrading

Upgrade your Sidekiq gems with `bundle up sidekiq-pro`.
This will pull upgrades for sidekiq-pro, sidekiq and all lower-level dependent gems.

**Warning**: using `bundle up sidekiq` can lead to incompatible gem versions in use.
