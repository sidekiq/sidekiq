        #
        # So in N*M second timespan, we want each process to schedule once.  The basic loop is:
        #
        # * sleep a random amount within that N*M timespan
        # * wake up and schedule
        #
        # We want to avoid one edge case: imagine a set of 2 processes, scheduling every 5 seconds,
        # so N*M = 10.  Each process decides to randomly sleep 8 seconds, now we've failed to meet
        # that 5 second average. Thankfully each schedule cycle will sleep randomly so the next
        # iteration could see each process sleep for 1 second, undercutting our average.
        #
        # So below 10 processes, we special case and ensure the processes sleep closer to the average.
        # In the example above, each process should schedule every 10 seconds on average. We special
        # case smaller clusters to add 50% so they would sleep somewhere between 5 and 15 seconds.
        # As we run more processes, the scheduling interval average will approach an even spread
        # between 0 and poll interval so we don't need this artifical boost.

      # and really bad if the retry or scheduled sets are large.
      #
      # Instead try to avoid polling more than once every 15 seconds.  If you have
      # 30 Sidekiq processes, we'll poll every 30 * 15 or 450 seconds.
      # To keep things statistically random, we'll sleep a random amount between
      # 225 and 675 seconds for each poll or 450 seconds on average.  Otherwise restarting
      # all your Sidekiq processes at the same time will lead to them all polling at
