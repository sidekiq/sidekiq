  # The Processor is a standalone thread which:
  #
  # 1. fetches a job from Redis
  # 2. executes the job
  #   a. instantiate the job class
  #   b. run the middleware chain
  #   c. call #perform
  #
  # A Processor can exit due to shutdown or due to
  # an error during job execution.
  #
  # If an error occurs in the job execution, the
  # Processor calls the Manager to create a new one
  # to replace itself and exits.
