  ##
  # The Manager is the central coordination point in Sidekiq, controlling
  # the lifecycle of the Processors.
  #
  # Tasks:
  #
  # 1. start: Spin up Processors.
  # 3. processor_died: Handle job failure, throw away Processor, create new one.
  # 4. quiet: shutdown idle Processors.
  # 5. stop: hard stop the Processors by deadline.
  #
  # Note that only the last task requires its own Thread since it has to monitor
  # the shutdown process.  The other tasks are performed by other threads.
