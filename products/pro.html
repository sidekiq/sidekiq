      <h3>Reliability</h3>
      <h6>More reliable message processing.</h6>
      <p>Cloud environments are noisy and unreliable. Seeing timeouts? Wild swings in latency or performance?
        Ruby VM crashes or processes disappearing?</p>
      <p>If a Sidekiq process crashes while processing a job, that job is lost.</p>
      <p>If the Sidekiq client gets a networking error while pushing a job to Redis, an exception is raised
        and the job is not delivered.</p>
      <p>Sidekiq Pro uses Redis's RPOPLPUSH command to ensure that jobs will not be lost if the process
        crashes or gets a KILL signal.</p>
      <p>The Sidekiq Pro client can withstand transient Redis outages or timeouts. It will enqueue jobs
        locally upon error and attempt to deliver those jobs once connectivity is restored.</p>

      <h3>Batches</h3>
      <h6>Group jobs into a set and follow their progress.</h6>
      <p>Create a set of jobs which can be tracked as a group, programmatically or within the Sidekiq Web
        interface. You can see success and failure counts along with error information for failed jobs
        within the batch.</p>
      <p>Batches can fire a callback when all jobs are complete, allowing much more complex job workflows than
        Sidekiq.</p>
