# /etc/init/sidekiq.conf - Sidekiq config

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See sidekiq-manager.conf for how to manage all Sidekiq instances at once.
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/sidekiq.conf then manage sidekiq with:
#   sudo start sidekiq app=/path/to/app index=0
#   sudo stop sidekiq app=/path/to/app  index=0
#   sudo status sidekiq app=/path/to/app index=0
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service sidekiq {start,stop,restart,status}
#
