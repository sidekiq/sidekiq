#
# This file tells systemd how to run Sidekiq as a 24/7 long-running daemon.
#
# Customize this file based on your bundler location, app directory, etc.
#
# If you are going to run this as a user service (or you are going to use capistrano-sidekiq)
# Customize and copy this to ~/.config/systemd/user
# Then run:
#   - systemctl --user enable sidekiq
#   - systemctl --user {start,stop,restart} sidekiq
# Also you might want to run:
#   - loginctl enable-linger username
# So that the service is not killed when the user logs out.
#
# If you are going to run this as a system service
# Customize and copy this into /usr/lib/systemd/system (CentOS) or /lib/systemd/system (Ubuntu).
# Then run:
#   - systemctl enable sidekiq
#   - systemctl {start,stop,restart} sidekiq
#
# This file corresponds to a single Sidekiq process.  Add multiple copies
# to run multiple processes (sidekiq-1, sidekiq-2, etc).
#
# Use `journalctl -u sidekiq -rn 100` to view the last 100 lines of log output.

# As of v6.0.6, Sidekiq automatically supports systemd's `Type=notify` and watchdog service
# monitoring. If you are using an earlier version of Sidekiq, change this to `Type=simple`
# and remove the `WatchdogSec` line.

Type=notify
NotifyAccess=all
# If your Sidekiq process locks up, systemd's watchdog will restart it within seconds.
