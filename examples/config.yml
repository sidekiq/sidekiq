# Sample configuration file for Sidekiq.
#
# Options here can still be overridden by cmd line args.
# Place this file at config/sidekiq.yml and Sidekiq will pick it up automatically.

# Raising concurrency can cause CPU overload. For example, Heroku's basic dynos have very little CPU compared to modern servers.
# :concurrency: 5

# Concurrency can be overridden based on environment as well.
# production:
#   :concurrency: 5
# staging:
#   :concurrency: 5

# Sidekiq will run this file through ERB when reading it so you can even put in dynamic logic, like a host-specific queue.
