You may choose to license Sidekiq in one of two ways:

- Open Source under the GPLv3

  Please see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html> for license text.

- Commercial License

  The Sencha commercial software license in COMM-LICENSE.  You must pledge
  $50 to my Pledgie fund at http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16623 to use
  this license.

The commercial license is just meant to help support my OSS work.  If
you do buy the commercial licensing option, thank you for your support!

The commercial license is meant to be per-site.  Consulting shops must buy
one license per client engagement which uses Sidekiq.  For instance,
GitHub could license Sidekiq for $50 for their own internal use but they
must pay $50 per GitHub::FI install because FI is a separate installation
from the GitHub website managed by the FI customer.
